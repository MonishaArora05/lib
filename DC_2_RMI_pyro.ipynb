    "Nice! You're translating an RMI-based Java assignment into Python using **Pyro5**, which is üî• the Python equivalent of RMI. Let‚Äôs structure this implementation properly so you can put it directly into your assignment and show off your distributed computing skills.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **AIM:**\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement Remote Method Invocation (RMI) using Pyro5 in Python to perform string concatenation on the server and return the result to the client.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **PROBLEM STATEMENT:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Design a distributed application using RMI for remote computation where the client submits two strings to the server, and the server returns the concatenation of those strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **THEORY (Python version with Pyro5):**\n",
    "\n",
    "Remote Method Invocation (RMI) in Java can be emulated in Python using the **Pyro5** library, which allows objects to expose methods to remote clients. It helps us create distributed systems where a **client can call server-side methods as if they were local**.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### üîç Key Concepts in Pyro5:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Remote Object (Service Class):**\n",
    "   A Python class decorated with `@Pyro5.api.expose` so its methods can be called remotely.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Daemon (Server):**\n",
    "   A background listener that registers the exposed object and waits for incoming client requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Client Proxy:**\n",
    "   A lightweight object that connects to the remote server using the provided URI and allows the client to call remote methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Pyro Name Server (Optional but useful):**\n",
    "   Acts like a directory for objects, but for simplicity, we‚Äôre directly using the URI.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Advantages of Pyro5 (Python RMI style):**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Language Simplicity:** Python code is more concise and beginner-friendly.\n",
    "* **Cross-Platform Friendly:** Easier to set up than Java RMI, especially for quick local demos.\n",
    "* **Supports Remote Method Calls:** Just like Java RMI, but using Pythonic syntax.\n",

    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   python string_server.py\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Copy the printed URI from the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Run the client in a new terminal**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   python string_client.py\n",

    "## üß† THEORY ‚Äì Implementing RMI-like Behavior in Python using Pyro5\n",
    "\n",
    "### üßæ What is Remote Method Invocation in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Remote Method Invocation (RMI) is a concept where a **client can invoke methods on a remote server object as if it's local**. In Java, this is achieved using RMI APIs. In **Python**, we replicate this behavior using the **Pyro5 (Python Remote Objects)** library.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pyro5 allows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A **server** to expose class methods.\n",
    "* A **client** to connect to the server over the network and call those methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "This enables **distributed computing** where tasks are performed remotely, yet the code feels like local function calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üõ† Components in Pyro5 (Python RMI Architecture)\n",
    "\n",
    "| Component                             | Purpose                                                               |\n",
    "| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n",
    "| **Remote Object**                     | A Python class whose methods you want to expose remotely (`@expose`). |\n",
    "| **Daemon (Server)**                   | Registers the object and listens for client requests.                 |\n",
    "| **Client Proxy**                      | Connects to the remote object using a URI and calls methods on it.    |\n",
    "| **URI (Uniform Resource Identifier)** | Identifies and connects to the server object across the network.      |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîó How the System Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Server Side:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Define a class `StringService` with a `concatenate()` method.\n",
    "   * Register this class with a Pyro5 daemon.\n",
    "   * The server listens continuously for incoming calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Client Side:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * The client uses the URI to get a reference to the remote object.\n",
    "   * It calls the `concatenate()` method, passing two strings.\n",
    "   * The server processes it and returns the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows string operations to be done on the server ‚Äî all initiated by the client, over the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üí° Why use Pyro5?\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Simplifies distributed apps** without needing full-blown REST APIs or sockets.\n",
    "* **Pythonic** and beginner-friendly.\n",
    "* Works well for educational projects, simulations, and lightweight apps.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üìå Real-Life Applications (Where This Concept Is Used)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Remote data processing servers (like ML model APIs).\n",
    "* Microservices architecture.\n",
    "* Cloud-hosted services where computation happens server-side.\n",
    "* Messaging systems or chat apps with a central processing unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üìò Example Use Case in This Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "A client wants to send two strings to a server and get back their concatenation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Pyro5 to let the client call a remote method `concatenate(s1, s2)` on the server and return `s1 + s2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üéØ Potential Viva Questions and Answers\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are **common external viva questions** based on this assignment:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q1. What is RMI and how is it achieved in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "RMI (Remote Method Invocation) allows a client to call methods on a server object remotely. In Python, this is implemented using the Pyro5 library, which allows remote method calls between objects across a network using a URI to identify the remote object.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q2. What does `@Pyro5.api.expose` do?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "This decorator marks a method or class to be exposed to remote calls. Without it, Pyro5 will not allow the client to invoke the method remotely.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q3. What is a URI in Pyro5?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "It stands for **Uniform Resource Identifier**. It's a unique address for the remote object which the client uses to connect and call the method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: `PYRO:obj_123456@localhost:50000`\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q4. What‚Äôs the difference between Java RMI and Python Pyro5?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Java RMI** is Java-only, strictly typed, and uses a registry server.\n",
    "* **Pyro5** is Python-specific, more dynamic, and can use direct URIs or a name server.\n",
    "* Pyro5 is easier to set up for small or educational projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q5. What are the advantages of using Pyro5?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Simple to implement.\n",
    "* Abstracts away socket programming.\n",
    "* Ideal for testing distributed systems in Python.\n",
    "* Methods feel like local calls but are actually remote.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q6. How is Pyro5 different from using sockets directly?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "Using sockets requires manual message formatting, sending, and receiving, whereas Pyro5 handles all of that internally, making the developer focus on logic rather than networking.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q7. Why is `__name__ == \"__main__\"` used?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "It ensures that the main function runs **only** when the script is executed directly, not when it's imported as a module.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q8. How does the client know where the server is?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "Through the **URI** printed by the server. The client uses this URI to locate and connect to the server object.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q9. Can Pyro5 be used over the internet?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "Yes, Pyro5 can work over LAN, WAN, or even the internet, but it may require setting firewall permissions, IP configurations, and using secure sockets.\n",
