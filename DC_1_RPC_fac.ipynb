    "* RPC stands for **Remote Procedure Call**.\n",
    "* It lets one program (**client**) call a function that runs in another program (**server**) as if it was a normal local function.\n",
    "* It **hides the complexity** of sending messages over the network.\n",

    "* You (client) place an order (call a function).\n",
    "* The kitchen (server) prepares the food (does the work).\n",
    "* You get your food delivered (get the result).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔹 Why Use RPC?\n",
    "\n",
    "* You **separate logic**: client handles input/output; server does the calculation.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 **THEORY: Code Implementation Explained**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, we implemented a **Remote Procedure Call (RPC)** based system using Python’s `xmlrpc` module to create a **simple client-server application**. The client takes an integer input from the user and sends it to the server. The server receives this input, computes the **factorial** using recursion, and returns the result to the client.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚙️ **Implementation Breakdown**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔹 Server-Side Implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "* We used Python’s built-in `SimpleXMLRPCServer` to create a lightweight RPC server.\n",
    "* A **recursive factorial function** is defined to calculate the factorial of a given number.\n",
    "* The server registers two remote functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. **`factorial(n)`** – Computes the factorial and returns the result.\n",
    "  2. **`shutdown()`** – Allows the server to shut down gracefully when requested by the client.\n",
    "* The server listens on **`localhost:8000`**, awaiting client requests, and runs indefinitely using `serve_forever()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔹 Client-Side Implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The client uses `xmlrpc.client.ServerProxy` to connect to the server.\n",
    "* It continuously prompts the user for input using a loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * If the user enters a number, the client sends it to the server via RPC and displays the returned factorial result.\n",
    "  * If the user types `\"exit\"`, the client invokes the `shutdown()` method on the server and exits the loop.\n",
    "* This simulates **real-time interaction**, where remote computation happens seamlessly without the client knowing the internal logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📈 **Connection to the AIM**\n",
    "\n",
    "* The **goal** was to offload the computation (factorial) to a remote server using RPC.\n",
    "* The **client is lightweight**—it handles only input/output, while the **server handles computation**.\n",
    "* The **RPC mechanism** makes this communication smooth, transparent, and similar to calling a local function.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ **Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation demonstrates how **RPC abstracts complex networking details**, enabling us to design modular, distributed systems. It meets the assignment’s aim by successfully:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Accepting input at the client-side,\n",
    "* Processing the factorial remotely at the server-side, and\n",

    "### **ASSIGNMENT 1**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **PROBLEM STATEMENT:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Design a distributed application using RPC for remote computation where the client submits an integer value to the server, and the server calculates the factorial and returns the result to the client program.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **THEORY:**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Remote Procedure Call (RPC):**\n",
    "\n",
    "Remote Procedure Call is a protocol that allows a program to request a service from another program located on a different computer over a network. It hides the complexities of network communication and allows programmers to write distributed applications as if all operations were local.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Main Goals of RPC:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Transparency** – Makes remote calls appear like local ones.\n",
    "* **Simplicity** – Hides low-level networking details.\n",
    "* **Interoperability** – Supports communication across systems via standardized protocols.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **How RPC Works:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Client Stub** – Packs procedure name and parameters into a request.\n",
    "2. **Transport Layer** – Sends the message over the network.\n",
    "3. **Server Stub** – Unpacks the message and calls the procedure.\n",
    "4. **Execution** – Procedure runs on the server.\n",
    "5. **Response** – Result is packed and returned to the client.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Application of RPC to Compute Factorial of a Number:**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Client-Server Model:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Client accepts an integer input and sends it to the server via RPC.\n",
    "* Server receives the input, computes the factorial, and returns the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Remote Computation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Computation is done on the server, reducing the client’s load.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Real-Time Result Delivery:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Fast response with a seamless user experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Components of the RPC Application:**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Client:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Accepts user input.\n",
    "* Sends input to the server via RPC.\n",
    "* Receives and displays the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Server:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Listens for requests.\n",
    "* Extracts input and computes factorial.\n",
    "* Returns result to the client.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **RPC Stubs:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Handle marshalling (serialization) and unmarshalling (deserialization) of data between client and server.\n",
    "* Hide underlying network logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Factorial of a Number:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The factorial of a non-negative integer `n` is the product of all positive integers ≤ `n`.\n",
    "It is denoted as:\n",
    "**n! = n × (n-1) × (n-2) × ... × 1**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Advantages of RPC:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* ✅ Transparency\n",
    "* ✅ Simplified communication\n",
    "* ✅ Code reusability\n",
    "* ✅ Platform independence\n",
    "* ✅ Modularity\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Limitations of RPC:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* ❌ Network dependency\n",
    "* ❌ Limited error handling\n",
    "* ❌ Security issues\n",
    "* ❌ Complex deployment\n",
    "* ❌ Platform compatibility issues\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **CONCLUSION:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation of Remote Procedure Call (RPC) for computing the factorial of an integer successfully demonstrates the effectiveness of distributed computing in simplifying complex client-server interactions. By offloading the computation to a server, the system maintains a clear separation of responsibilities while enhancing performance and scalability. The client-server communication is abstracted to resemble local function calls, showcasing RPC's transparency and ease of use. The result is returned seamlessly, maintaining the accuracy and reliability of the output. This assignment highlights how RPC can be utilized to build efficient, modular, and maintainable distributed applications.\n",
