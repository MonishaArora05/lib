    "### **THEORY**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Load Balancing**\n",
    "\n",
    "Load balancing is the technique of evenly distributing network traffic or computational tasks across multiple servers, computers, or resources. The goal is to ensure that no single server is overwhelmed, which could cause delays or system crashes.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Objectives of Load Balancing**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Optimized Resource Utilization**\n",
    "   Ensures that all servers share the workload evenly.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **High Availability & Reliability**\n",
    "   Prevents service disruptions by rerouting traffic if a server fails.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Scalability**\n",
    "   Enables seamless addition of servers to handle increasing demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Reduced Latency**\n",
    "   Routes requests to the fastest or least busy server to minimize response time.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Fault Tolerance**\n",
    "   Maintains system performance during hardware or software failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "### **Load Balancing Algorithms**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Round Robin**\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm distributes incoming requests in a cyclic order. It assigns the first request to the first server, the second to the second server, and so on. After the last server, it loops back to the first.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Use Case**: Ideal when all servers have similar capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Ensures even distribution of traffic\n",
    "* Easy to understand and implement\n",

    "**Cons**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Ignores current server load or response time\n",
    "* Can be inefficient if server capacities vary\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Weighted Round Robin**\n",
    "\n",
    "An enhanced version of Round Robin, this algorithm assigns weights to each server based on its processing capacity. Requests are distributed in proportion to these weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Use Case**: Suitable when servers have different capabilities.\n",

    "**Pros**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Balances load according to server capacity\n",

    "* Assigning appropriate weights can be complex\n",
    "* Still does not consider real-time server load\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Least Connections**\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm selects the server with the fewest active connections at any given time. It dynamically adjusts to the current load on each server.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Use Case**: Effective in scenarios with variable request durations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Dynamically balances load based on active connections\n",
    "* Prevents overloading any single server\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons**:\n",

    "* May be suboptimal if server capabilities vary\n",
    "* Requires real-time tracking of connections\n",

    "\n",
    "* **Use Case**: When response speed is critical.\n",
    "\n",

    "* Minimizes latency by choosing the fastest server\n",
    "* Adapts to changes in server performance\n",

    "Here are **important viva questions and answers** related to your **Load Balancing Assignment** – designed for quick review and easy understanding:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ **Basic Concept Questions**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. What is load balancing?**\n",
    "**Ans:** Load balancing is the process of distributing incoming requests or workloads across multiple servers to avoid overloading any single server and to improve performance, availability, and reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Why is load balancing important in distributed systems?**\n",
    "**Ans:** It prevents server overload, ensures even distribution of work, improves response time, increases system reliability, and allows the system to scale efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. What are some common load balancing algorithms?**\n",
    "**Ans:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Round Robin\n",
    "* Weighted Round Robin\n",
    "* Least Connections\n",
    "* Least Response Time\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. What are the main goals of load balancing?**\n",
    "**Ans:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Optimized resource utilization\n",
    "* High availability\n",
    "* Scalability\n",
    "* Reduced latency\n",
    "* Fault tolerance\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ **Algorithm-Specific Questions**\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. How does the Round Robin algorithm work?**\n",
    "**Ans:** It assigns each incoming request to the next server in a circular sequence, irrespective of the server's current load.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. What is the difference between Round Robin and Weighted Round Robin?**\n",
    "**Ans:** In Round Robin, all servers are treated equally. In Weighted Round Robin, servers with higher capacities are assigned more requests based on their weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "**7. How does the Least Connections algorithm decide the server?**\n",
    "**Ans:** It chooses the server that currently has the fewest active client connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "**8. When is the Least Response Time algorithm preferred?**\n",
    "**Ans:** When minimizing latency is critical, as it selects the server with the fastest current response time.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ **Implementation & Code Questions**\n",
    "\n",
    "**9. Why is `random` used in the code?**\n",
    "**Ans:** It simulates randomness in request distribution and is used to pick a server among equally eligible options (e.g., in Least Connections).\n",
    "\n",
    "**10. What does `time.sleep()` do in this context?**\n",
    "**Ans:** It simulates delay or server response time to mimic real-world network behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "**11. What is the purpose of `simulate_response_time()`?**\n",
    "**Ans:** It creates a fake server response time using a random delay to test the Least Response Time algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "**12. What does `current_index = (current_index + 1) % len(servers)` mean?**\n",
    "**Ans:** It ensures circular iteration over the server list, i.e., after reaching the last server, it starts again from the first.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ **Practical/Real-World Questions**\n",
    "\n",
    "**13. Where is load balancing used in real life?**\n",
    "**Ans:** It’s used in web servers (e.g., Google, Amazon), cloud platforms (AWS, Azure), and any system with high user traffic.\n",
    "\n",
    "**14. What happens if load balancing is not used?**\n",
    "**Ans:** Some servers may become overloaded, leading to high response times, crashes, or service unavailability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**15. Can a load balancer be a hardware or software?**\n",
    "**Ans:** Yes, it can be both. Hardware load balancers are physical devices, while software load balancers run on servers (e.g., NGINX, HAProxy).\n",
    "\n",
    "**16. What is the difference between static and dynamic load balancing?**\n",
    "**Ans:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Static**: Distribution decisions are predefined (e.g., Round Robin).\n",
    "* **Dynamic**: Decisions depend on real-time factors like current load or response time (e.g., Least Connections, Least Response Time).\n",
